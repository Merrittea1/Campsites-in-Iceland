##  Campsites in Iceland

### Introduction
###### This application allows for its user to view many of the campsites in Iceland, see what regions have the most campsites, and access names of each site. It also allows users to know if they will have to payto access a site or if the site is free. Luckily, most of the sites found in Iceland are free! The user is able to zoom and pan the map, but the base layer remains fairly basic to avoid confusion.

### Major Functions
###### This map allows for panning, and zooming. It also provides the name of each campsite when the user clicks on an icon, which remains visible until clicked off of. The title and legend are static and always present for the user to see while using the map.

### Libraries and Data Sources
###### This map was created using the Leaflet library, jquery, the Color Chroma librart and fontawesome. Font Awesome provided the tent icon, Leaflet provided the basemap, and Chroma colors were used for the icon and choropleth color coding. The data from the map was sources through Princeton Maps and MapFindr, and imported in the format of a GeoJson.
